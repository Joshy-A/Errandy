**Errandy: A Student Errand Running App**

**Project Overview**

Errandy is a mobile application designed to facilitate errand-running between students within a university setting. It streamlines the process of requesting and completing tasks for each other, promoting a collaborative and supportive community.

**Features**

* **Landing Page:** Provides a clear introduction to Errandy, explaining its purpose and benefits for students. 
* **Registration:** Users can register with their  details
* **Seamless Login:** Allows registered users to easily access the platform using their credentials. B
* **Request Page:**
    * View all posted errands: Users can browse requests from others within the university community.
    * View requests: Users can express interest in completing an errand by accepting a request. This could trigger a notification and/or chat message to the request originator.
    * Request Creation:* Users can easily post their own errands, specifying details like the task description and location.
* **Integrated Chat:** Enables seamless communication between users. Users can discuss errand details, negotiate terms, and coordinate completion. 

**Challenges**

* **Verification and Trust:** Ensuring users are legitimate students within the university might require collaboration with the university administration. Consider integrating verification processes or reputation systems to build user trust.
* **Payment Integration (Optional):** If users wish to offer compensation for errands, consider integrating secure payment options like mobile wallets or university-approved payment systems.
* **Location-Based Services:** Implementing location-based features to find nearby errands or suggest suitable runners would require careful consideration of user privacy and data security.

**Future Implementations**

* **Reputation System:** Develop a rating system where users can leave feedback for each other, fostering a sense of accountability and reliability.
* **Task Categorization:** Allow users to categorize errands (e.g., pick-up/delivery, library tasks, printing services) for easier searching and filtering.
* **Advanced Search:** Implement search functionalities based on location, time frame, task category, or keywords in errand descriptions.
* **Push Notifications:** Send real-time notifications to users for new requests, accepted tasks, or chat messages.
* **Gamification Elements (Optional):** Consider incorporating gamification elements like points or badges to incentivize active participation and a sense of accomplishment.

**How to Build**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Ensure you have Python version 3 or later installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python --version` in your terminal. If you don't have Python, download and install it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/errandy.git
    ```
    Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. You can use tools like `venv` or `virtualenv` for this:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # For Windows
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
    Activate the virtual environment (if you created one) and navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd errandy
    ```
    Install the project's dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Make sure the `requirements.txt` file includes Flask, Flask-SocketIO, and any other required libraries.

5. **Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory. This file will store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and Flask secret key (for session management). You can use a service like Heroku or Netlify to manage environment variables securely. An example `.env` file might look like this:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    SECRET_
